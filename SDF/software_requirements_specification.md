# Software Requirements Specification

## 5.1   Introduction <br>
            The system being designed in this project is a video game titled Being. The game will be semi-open world, meaning that there will be large playspaces for the player to explore freely however it won't be infinitely generated and each playspace will have edges close to the map into a finite space. The game will also be a story game in which the player, while still allowed freedom, can only progress forward by completing steps along the set story until the main storyline finishes, where the player can then freely explore the unlocked playspaces at their discretion. After the main storyline, there will still be endgame content in which the player can face challenges that may provide further insight into the lore of the story. The setting of the game will be a jungle as the entire planet in which it takes place has been overtaken by a lush environment. There will be a combat system implemented for the player to fight the various enemies, flora, and fauna, that inhabit the world. These inhabitants will range from basic enemies to boss enemies with their separate patterns and attacks.
