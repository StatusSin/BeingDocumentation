CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Jer Mendoza and Ari Ramchandran
Being game project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  You describe in detail what your game's about
   and what other games are similar which provides a context.  You have an
   admirable goal to the project of filling a percieved gap in the current
   state of video games.  You could put a little more information about the
   goals *within* the game, which you mentioned in your presentation but are
   left out here...

   The justification section is also well-done.  You include self-reflection
   about the project difficulty, for which you also state mitigations based
   on your experience as developers.  Nice work there.


Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look great, your justification
   of both the project goals and the applicability to the course are well-
   thought-out and clear.  The graphics in your presentation are lovely and
   peaceful scenes are always a plus in presentations.  You handled questions
   well and provided good detail on what the project is about and why you've
   decided to do it.

   Very nice work overall!

=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
