Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   This section is excellent!  Very complete and explanatory.  Nothing to
   add here.

-- Functional Requirements
   This is a good start, but you need more specificity in the requirement
   statements.  Also, watch out for multiple requirements in one statement.
   For example:

   IS:
   5.2.01.01 The Player Controller shall provide the player model with the
             ability to move and interact with the game world.

   SHOULD BE:
   5.2.1.1  The Player Controller shall provide the player model with the
            ability to move the player.
   5.2.1.2  The Player Controller shall provide the player model with the
            ability to interact with the game world.

   Any time you see 'and' in a requirement, think in terms of splitting it
   into two separate statements, or at least a "shall" and a "will".

   For something as significant as this game, I would think you'd need more
   than 17 functional requirements.  Think about all the parts you have
   listed and how they interact.  For example, you have only two requirement
   statements for your "models":

   5.2.04.01 The Models will all have a similar 'low-poly' design to create
             a cohesive aesthetic
   5.2.04.02 The Models for the player and enemies will all be rigged and
             properly animated (5.2.05)

   But what is meant by 'similar' if you don't have a place somewhere to say
   what the basis is for comparison?  What is meant by 'rigged'?  What is
   meant by "properly" animated?  You have both players and enemies listed
   in one requirement in 5.2.4.2 so that's a two-requirement statement.

   Other things to think over ~ will the 'player controller' be the only way
   to control things or will there be keyboard inputs to match?  What are
   the challenges at the various levels?  What are some of the textures you
   will use?  What is "mostly realistic sound"?  Is that something that will
   change based on the surroundings?  What will enemies do to 'serve as a
   barrier' and how many ways can they do that?  If more than one way, how
   is that selected?

   I think you get the idea...

-- Performance Requirements
   Unfortunately, it seems you have mixed 'performance' with 'environment'.
   The requirements you have in this subsection are the environmental
   needs for the project, so you can simply re-number then for that section
   and be done with that.  But this section needs some requirements that
   specify things like timing,

-- Environment Requirements
   See above.

=============================================================================
your score:  8% out of 10% which is a B.

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Don't get discouraged, NOBODY gets this stuff the first time, and you DO
have a really good start!  It's just that you have a significant application
which needs significant thought put into the requirements for it.

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission, including more
requirements, and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

No updates made to the document that I can see...
