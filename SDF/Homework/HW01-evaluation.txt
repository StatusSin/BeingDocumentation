Comments:
---------

problem 2.4 nice analysis of contrasting the two tools!

problem 2.5 Don't forget that JBGE can also apply to Test Driven Development!

problem 4.2 you are a little off on the tasks in the critical path.  They
   are G -> D -> E -> M -> Q or H -> I -> D -> E -> M -> Q.  Both paths add
   to a total of 32 days.

problem 4.4 it's hard to tell what the actual schedule is from this chart,
   but it IS a 'Gantt chart', sorta kinda....  what you usually see is more
   like a spreadsheet, with the tasks listed at the left in top-down order,
   in this case from A through R.  Each column to the right of that counts
   for one day and is labeled with the day of the week and the date of the
   month.  Month names span the top of the appropriate columns.  The bars
   reflect the duration in days, and often there is both a column that says
   the predecessor as well as lines and arrows to show what comes after what.
   Given the 32 days from the previous problem and the holiday constraints
   mentioned, the schedule should finish on February 18th or 19th.

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 excellent requirements for the game ~ you thought this through
   well...  Did you work together on these?  Seems like you both really got
   the messages on user interfaces!

Good job overall ~ keep up the good work you two!
