Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 47 out of 50 = 94% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-1: I see you "fixed" the code by removing the comments entirely.
   You might have considered putting ONE comment at the top to either tell
   how the algorithm works or have a link to a description

problem 7-5: Actually the error handling should be done by the CALLER not by
   the CALLED function.  You are correct that the called function will check
   for errors, but it should throw exceptions or report those errors back to
   the caller which is where they should be handled.

Problem 8-9: Exhaustive testing is actually BLACK BOX because you are given
   the inputs and matching outputs and it doesn't matter how the computation
   is done so you don't need to 'see' inside the function.

problem 8-11: you are correct that the Lincoln estimate only uses pairs of
   testers.  This means for Alice and Bob you have (5 * 4) / 2 = 10.  To get
   the proper number you need to do the calculation for all three possible
   combinations and then average the results to get 14 bugs.

Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you folks in my classes over the years,
and I look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world
and the industry.  Keep up the good work!
