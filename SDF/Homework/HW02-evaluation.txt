Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.6, do you REALLY need a database to store the drawing data?  I think it
might be enough to simply have a file format that would save the data which
would let the operating system file handing be responsible for data chores.
The ClassyDraw application might save 'interim' files so that a system
crash would not cause a loss of too much information.  I can see your point
about using a database, though, since that would be able to store/retrieve
data efficiently, too.

On 5.8 you are supposed to DRAW the state diagram, not DESCRIBE the state
diagram.  Your description is correct, but it's in language not drawing.

On 6.2 this is an interesting diagram!  It's not actually showing subclasses
from the class 'Drawable', but it is showing relationships between the class
names.  It's an interesting approach even though it's not the standard way
of doing an inheritance diagram.  Normally one would see boxes for every
class, and the top box would have the common attributes which would be
inherited by all the subclasses.  Subclass arrows would point from the lower
boxes to the upper boxes to show the "is-a" relationship and would contain
any unique attributes to those classes.  Your diagram is more of a "uses-a"
diagram, in which a 'star' "uses-a" 'line'.  I think.... :D

Still, points for originality!

Pretty good job on this one, and you're doing well overall.  Keep it up!
